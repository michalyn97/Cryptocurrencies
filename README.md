# Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to help my client at Accountabilty Accounting create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create classification system for a new investment.  

The results revealed there are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.  They were grouped by Total Coins Mined and Total Coin Supply.
